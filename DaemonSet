# DaemonSet
Documentation Link: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/

A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. 
As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. 
As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected. 
Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.

Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:
running a cluster storage daemon on every node
running a logs collection daemon on every node
running a node monitoring daemon on every node

- To display DaemonSet
> kubectl get ds
- To Delete DaemonSet:
> kubectl delete ds kplabs-daemonset

Example:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: kplabs-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: kplabs-all-pods
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: kplabs-all-pods
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kplabs-pods
        image: nginx
